// BRIEF DESCRIPTION
/*

The video standard ITU-R BT.656 imbeds all video field and line timing
by using non-video related data values. This data, when decoded,
provides downstream designs all of the timing information related to the
video stream.

//
// DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
//


The reserved 8 bit values of 00h and FFh (consumer format) or 10 bits
values of 000 and 3FFh (studio format) are used to signal what is known
as a TRS - Timing Reference Symbol.  The TRS consists of the sequence FF


a special word XY that
resides in either the 8 bit consumer field or the upper 8 bits of the 10
bit studio field (the 2 lsbs undefined). 

This word, when decoded, combined with various counts, such as line 
count, can completely specify NTSC or PAL timing.

This module decodes this information and supplies timing control signals
to the video controller, frame buffer, and DAC.

The video standard ITU-R BT.656, defines the following:

   1. color space
   2. the number of samples
   3. where the samples are located in an image, also known
      as the sampling format
   4. how the pixels are stored in the frame buffer. 

The color space definition is known as YCbCr. YCbCr is a scaled and
offset version of the YUV color space. The 4:2:2 format has for every
horizontal Y (Luminance) sample a single Chrominance sample (either 
Cr or Cb). Cb and Cr are sampled less because the eye is more sensitive 
to luminance than chrominance, so storing pixels this way is more frame 
buffer efficient. 

Each sample is 8 bits (for consumer applications)and 10 bits for 
commercial studio quality. The Virtex II video board supports 10 bits
where the two extra bits are considered fractional.  The range of
values for each are:

   Y  = 16 to 235 or 040h to 3ACh (i.e. 220 values)
   Cr = 16 to 240 or 040h to 3C0h (i.e. 225 values)
   Cb = 16 to 240 or 040h to 3C0h (i.e. 225 values)
   note: for Cr and Cb 128 is "zero"

The video data words are conveyed as 27 million, 10 bit words, in the
following order: 

             1    2   3    4   5    6   7
             Cb0, Y0, Cr0, Y1, Cb2, Y2, Cr2

Field and frame timing is actually imbedded in the data stream by
reserving the values of 00h and FFh for field/line ID. The pattern FF 00
00 is used as a field ID and appears in every line. If a field ID is
detected then the next 8 bit pixel has different meaning depending on
it's value. I'll call the value XY. The 8 bit data stream is sampled on
the rising edge of the 27 MHz clock.

The terms SAV and EAV mean "start of active video" and "end of active
video", repectively. SAV is marked with a field ID followed by bit 4 in
the XY word low. Active pixels then follow. EAV is also marked with a
field ID where bit 4 in the XY word is high. Horizontal blanking
follows.

Field number and Field blanking are also conveyed by XY, following a
field ID. The "F bit" or bit position 6 and the "V bit" or bit position
5 are decoded as follows:

F = 0, denotes field 1, odd
F = 1, denotes field 2, even
V = 0, denotes no field blanking
V = 1, denotes field blanking

So a simple statement of this modules function is, for each line, find
the field ID pattern FF 00 00 XY then look at XY. XY will tell us what
field we are in, whether or not field blanking is active, and if XY
denotes a SAV, then we know we are at pixel 0.  Deciding which format
is being displayed is done by counting SAVs between field blanking.

To identify the format as NTSC (485 active lines or 525 total lines) or
as PAL (576 active lines or 625 total) you can look for the V bit to
signal active lines are starting (V was a 1, then transitioned to a 0)
and count SAVs until the V bit goes high or active lines have stopped.
This number is compared to the format line counts and NTSC or PAL flag
is set.
